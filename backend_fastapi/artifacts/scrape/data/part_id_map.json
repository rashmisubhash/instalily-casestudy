It is rated as \"medium\" difficulty to install, is constructed of plastic and comes in white. If broken or missing, the pantry drawer will not stay in place and the part should be replaced. Refer to your user manual and model number to ensure this is the correct part for you. This kit includes both the right and left side end caps, as well as the pins that will hold them in place. To replace an end cap, remove the three screws holding it in place. Then, remove the pin and end cap, replacing the old end cap with the new end cap. In the past, the left and right end caps were sold separately, but the part has been updated and now includes both sides. The part is sold as a kit, and unfortunately, as such none of the parts are available individually.",

Installation is straightforward: locate the filter compartment inside the refrigerator, twist and remove the old filter, align the new filter with the connector, and twist it into place until secure. Once installed, flush the system by running water through the dispenser for several minutes to clear any air and activate the filter. Always verify compatibility with your refrigerator model before purchase, as this filter also replaces part numbers BORPLFTR55 and REPLFLTR55.",

This door seal is used in two-door fridges and therefore one door seal is required for each door. The seal prevents cold air from escaping and warm air from entering the refrigerator, to maintain a consistent temperature inside. The seal is located around the perimeter of the refrigerator door. Over time, the door seal can wear out, become cracked, or lose its elasticity. A faulty door seal will lead to increased energy consumption, inconsistent temperatures, and potential spoilage of food. To replace the door seal, simply peel off the old seal, and clean the sealing area. Align the new seal along the door perimeter and press it firmly into place to create a tight seal. Each order only comes with one door seal, therefore if both of your door gaskets are faulty, you will need to order two of these.",

It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating.  If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.",

This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This part is located inside of the control housing on most models, and is approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. This part is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white. It features 1 defrost timer, along with all necessary mounting hardware and installation instructions",

Over time, the gasket may become cracked or lose its sealing ability, leading to symptoms such as condensation on the door or difficulty opening and closing. Replacement is recommended if these issues occur, and installation typically involves removing the old gasket and pressing the new one into the designated groove around the door frame. Proper sealing is essential for optimal appliance performance and food preservation.",

The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.",

It can be located in either the freezer compartment near the evaporator coils or in the fresh food compartment near the airflow channels, depending on the model. If you notice issues like excessive icing in the freezer, inadequate cooling in the refrigerator, temperature fluctuations, or error messages on the display panel, it indicates a potential problem with the thermistor. Since your fridge will not be able to maintain the desired temperature, this results in food spoilage, inefficient cooling, and potential damage to the cooling components. To replace the thermistor, disconnect it from the connector plug or wiring harness and remove any mounting brackets or clips using a screwdriver if necessary. Remember to consult your user manual to determine the required number of thermistors, as they are sold individually as OEM replacement parts.",

    "description": "Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter SpecificationsThis OEM ice and water filter fits side-by-side and bottom-freezer GE models. The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.",

If you notice that your doors open and the mullion either moves freely or is stuck, this hinge needs to be replaced immediately to prevent issues with frost buildup, energy efficiency and temperature fluctuations. Replacing this hinge is quite simple, and you will only need a flathead and Philips-head screwdriver to do it. First, remove the screw covers from the securing screws for the mullion. Unscrew and remove the securing screws with your Philips-head screwdriver, and then pull the mullion up and out carefully to dislodge it from the fridge door. Near the middle of the mullion, disconnect the wire harness to remove the mullion completely. Remove the hinge cover with a flathead screwdriver to expose the hinge, and then carefully remove and replace the old hinge onto its attaching spring. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the door assembly, along with the hinge cover and wire harness.",

The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually.

It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.",

Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.",

The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey.

The valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. It is responsible for allowing water from the household water supply to enter the dishwasher tub during the wash cycle. The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub. If the valve is faulty, you will likely experience water leakages, difficulties filling dishwasher, and poor cleaning results. This part is commonly associated with the E15 error code on dishwashers.",

Clamps can wear out and lose their tension due to excessive vibrations, mechanical damage, and normal wear and tear, all things present within a washing machine. To replace this clamp, you will first need to turn off your washer and you will need access to the lower portion of the washer chassis, which may require one or multiple screwdrivers and wrenches. Once you have access, use your screwdriver to loosen this clamp, which can then be removed and replaced with the new clamp, which will need to be tightened securely. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the washer you originally disassembled.",

Over time, wear and tear may cause tears, gaps, or cuts in the gasket, leading to leaks. This genuine OEM replacement kit is compatible with select models of Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Inglis, and Magic Chef dishwashers. For proper installation, unplug the dishwasher or turn off the circuit breaker to ensure safety. Refer to the installation guide or video for step-by-step instructions, and wear protective gloves while replacing the gasket and strike.",

The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.",

This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.",

Its rotating motion sprays water in multiple directions, ensuring thorough cleaning. Typically, it is attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. When this part is broken, there are noticeable signs to be aware of. You might hear knocking or banging sounds coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may be wobbly or unable to rotate. If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.",
